Droppa clone works similar to droppa but it has some few features that aren't implemented. i have developed this sysytem as a reference since i was working at droppa as a java/android developer.

This system uses Json web token as part of security but i have disabled it just incase you want clone the source code and test it on you local machine.

# How to use the system
Make use of post man or download the apk under droppa_clone repository. Once you have cloned the system, you can just run it to activated the server and start using the system. Embeded tomcat uses port 8080 so you'll have to make sure that the port isn't used or you can just add a new port under application.properties file.
